The tool automatically:
- Retrieves all policy initiatives from your Azure subscription
- Counts and displays the total number of initiatives found
- Sorts initiatives alphabetically by display name
- Prepares the numbered list for selection

### Step 3: Selecting Source Initiative
![Step 3 - Select Source Initiative](Screenshots/3_SelectSourceInitiative.png)

In this step:
- All available policy initiatives are displayed in a formatted table
- Each initiative shows: Number, Name, Type (Built-in/Custom), Policy Count, and Original ID
- You select the SOURCE initiative by entering its number
- The tool confirms your selection

### Step 4: Selecting Compare Initiative

Next, you:
- Choose the initiative to COMPARE against your source
- The same numbered list is displayed again
- Select a different initiative number for comparison
- The tool confirms your second selection

### Step 5: Processing and Analysis

The tool then:
- Retrieves all policies from both selected initiatives
- Shows progress indicators during policy retrieval
- Analyzes policy overlaps and differences
- Processes each policy definition to extract names and categories

### Step 6: Comparison Summary
![Step 6 - Check Summary](Screenshots/6_CheckSummary.png)

Finally, the results are displayed:
- **Source Initiative**: Name, type, and total policy count
- **Compare Initiative**: Name, type, and total policy count  
- **Policy Analysis**: Number of overlapping, missing, and extra policies
- **Detailed Lists**: Complete enumeration of missing and extra policies

### Step 7: HTML Report Overview (Page 1)

- Report header with generation timestamp
- Initiative comparison table with key metrics
- Clean, professional styling for easy reading

### Step 8: HTML Report - Policy Overlap Section
![Step 8 - Report Overview 2](Screenshots/8_ReportOverview2.png)

The HTML report includes:
